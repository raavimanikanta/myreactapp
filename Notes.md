## React Introduction :
ReactJS is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building reusable UI components. 
It is the open source ,component based front end library responsible for the view layer of the application.
## Features of the react:
### The main features of the react are:
### Jsx:
Jsx stands for javaScript Xml ,it is Html like syntax which allows us to write Html in react.It converts Html tags to the react elements.
### Virtual Dom :
 Virtual dom is the simple representation of the real dom.It has the same features which real dom has i.e,properties and methods like the real dom .
 ### Virtual dom working :
 At first the virtual dom gets updated and after that the changes made in the virtual dom are compared with the actual dom (real dom),then these changes are updated in the actual dom(real dom).The process of comparing virtual dom and real dom is called deffing algorithem.These entire process is done to control the re-render process and code gets executed fast.It takes less time to execute.
### Components:
  In React Everything is based on components. In react components a piece of code is written and these component along with the code can be used when ever needed without creating the component and writing logic again and again.In react components can be created in two ways 1.Functional component and the 2.Class components.Based on the requirement the type components are used.
  ### SPA(Single page application):
  When we click on a button or any other links in the websites or applications,the page gets refreshed and it directs to the another wesites,these happens because of the website is made up of multiple pages and every time the entire applcation gets refreshed.The process of directing to other pages without refreshing the application is called as the single page application,these is achieved in react by using the Routing process.
  ### Simplicity and Performance:
  Creating the application or website using the react components and routing is simple and complexity is less and the performance is good as the react app is made as single page application.It takes less time to render the components.
  ## Library and Framework:
   Libraries and frameworks are the code written by someone else that helps you perform some common problems.
  ## Library:
    library is a collection of predefined functions and classes that are available for the developers to make their work little faster and to boost the developing process.
    Developers can call the code from library when and where they need it while developing the own application.
  ## Framework:
    A framework just gives us basic structure and to that structure we can add our own code to have significant functionality.
    By using framework we can learn creating applications and websites in more standardized way.
    while using framework we are in control with it(framework)
